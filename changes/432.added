Added an SSoT to sync Nautobot ==> Itential Automation Gateway.

This integration allows users to sync Nautobot device inventory to Itential Automation Gateway(s) (IAG).
The current IAG inventory that is supported is its default Ansible inventory.
Netmiko, Nornir, HTTP requests inventories will be added at a later date.
